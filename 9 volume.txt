A volume is a specially designated directory within one or more containers that
bypasses the Union File System to provide several useful features for persistent or
shared data:

• Volumes can be shared and reused between containers.
• A container doesn’t have to be running to share its volumes.
• Changes to a volume are made directly.
• Changes to a volume will not be included when you update an image.
• Volumes persist until no containers use them.

This allows us to add data (like source code), a database, or other content into an
image without committing it to the image and allows us to share that data between
containers. 

This means that changes to a volume are made directly and bypass the image. 
They will not be included when we commit or build an image.

-v option allows us to create a volume in our container from a directory on the host
The -v option works by specifying a directory or mount on the local host separated
from the directory on the container with a :. If the container directory doesn’t
exist Docker will create it.

docker volume ls
